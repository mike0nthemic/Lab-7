    <h1>My Time Living in San Francisco</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Growing up, I lived in the same city for about 19 years. I wanted to leave my comfort zone and live away
        from
        home. When applying to college, I picked schools away from home, so it's easier to go back and forth between
        home and school. One of the schools I chose was San Francisco State because I visited the city once and fell
        in
        love with it. I definitely wanted to see what it felt like living there on my own. Out of my two options, I
        choose that school to go to college. Despite only going for a year because of the cost of housing, I really
        enjoyed my time there and would like to share some of the places I enjoyed while I was over there.

                    Japan Town is another palce a friend showed me while I was going to school there. Her and couple of
                    her friends invited me one weekend. The area is really small but has a lot of character. It reminds
                    me a lot of little tokyo in Los Angeles. Where there is a lot of store that sell Japanese clothing,
                    media, and food. I went back a couple more times on my own because the food there was really good
                    and cheap. Every time I go to San Francisco I make sure to stop by there everytime I visit.

            <figcaption>
                Little Italy is an awesome place if you love italian food because there nothing but pasta and pizza
                places there. When I was living there I've only gone by there a couple of times when I was riding my
                bicycle through the city, but never got the chance to stop and check it out. A couple of years ago I had
                the chance to check it out because of a friend told me that there are some hidden gems there and some
                romantic spots you can take your significat other to.

            <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Fishermans Wharf</h3>
            <figcaption>
                The first place that I visisted on my own was Fishermans wharf. I went there because it was by the water
                and I've been there one other time but drove by and never walked around to check it out. So on my
                weekend I saw it as an opportunity to see what they had there and explore. The area has a lot of sea
                food and tourist things to do. But if you're in the area on Taylor st, there are little stand that are
                selling popcorn shrimp and some other kind of seafood. I would definitely recommend going there for the
                food and to walk around. But make sure to bring a jacket because its really cold there at night.

            <figcaption>
                The first place I ever visited when I got to San Francisco was the Castro District. It was quite
                surprising to me when I got there because I did not know that the majority of the community that lived
                there was part of LGBTQ+. My school offered to teach us how to use public transportation there, and that
                was the place we were going. When we got there, we walked around a bit to see what they had there. They
                also have a really good cookie shop there called Hot Cookie. I would definitely recommend going there if
                you're in the area and checking out the Harvey Milk Museum.
